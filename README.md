Collection of highly compatible test vectors.

This project is TBD someday...

###Cryptography

- [MSR JavaScript Cryptography Library](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/29f9385d-da4c-479a-b2ea-2a7bb335d727/) - over 800Mb! of testvectors. Some in text, some in code.
- [Tests for Cryptography Python Library](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/tree/master/vectors) - a lot of vectors in uniformed old-school textual format.
- [NIST CSRC Cryptography Toolkit test vectors](https://github.com/coruus/nist-testvectors) Good point to start digging. Everything in some raw textual format.
- [Projects of Kenji Urushima](https://github.com/kjur): [jsrsasign](http://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/) and [jsjws](http://kjur.github.io/jsjws/) contains high quality tests inside JavaScript code.
